Dependencies on Other Workers:
	. Notify Worker 1 of Dependency on their job of Worker 2

Sender will send:
	. To Worker 1 to inform Worker 2 of cmd_id result 
	( queue_cronio_workers_worker_1 )

	with Inform ie:


	. To Worker 2 that the cmd_id has a dependency from Worker 1
	( queue_cronio_workers_dependency_worker_2 )
	
	. Notify Worker 2 of Result of work done from Worker 1

	. Check if the Worker is the same one skip the dependency?

S -> W1, Inform(W2,1)
- W1->I(W2,1)-> DB

		If there is an entry send it to Workers needed to receive notification for.

	Check if it can be executed from the dependencies.


W1 -> W2, Result(W1,1)
